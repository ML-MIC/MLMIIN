They were conceived in an attempt to provide an abstract model of the operations performed by the neurons in the animal brains. Of course, a biological neuron is a far more sophisticated system with a complex regulation composed of chemical and electrical signals. To say that the artificial neuron is a simplistic model of the biological reality is a huge understatement. But the analogy sticked, and up to the present these computational units are still referred to as artificial neurons.

        "Some theoretical misunderstandings related to the network collapse phenomenon combined with the limitations of the hardware led to what was called the [*first AI winter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) and research stalled for a long time. Another factor contributing to that decrease of interest in AI was of an algorithmic nature. Some pioneering researchers already knew that multilayer models and non linear activations would solve the issue. But at the time it was not known *how to train a multilayer model*. A new fundamental algorithm, called **backpropagation** was needed for that.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the meantime, a second era of AI methods appeared in the form of so called *expert systems* in the 1980s. They relied on a completely different methodology: *rule-based systems*. Those are built on a set of explicit rules or if-then statements that try to encode the knowledge and expertise of human experts. In particular they did not use neural networks. But they turned out to be too hard to maintain, and the expectations, hype and investments soon vanished. The second AI winter and the bursting of the dot-com bubble (driven by speculative investment in internet-related companies during the late 1990s) occurred around the same time period. Thus, for a long time, the AI name vanished from the research vocabulary. But the neural networks researchers had kept working and in 1986 the [**backpropagation algorithm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation#Early_successes) became popular due to a paper in Nature. It had some success, but it was not until the 2010s, when comparatively cheap yet powerful GPUs  became available, that backprop (as it is usually called) found the adequate hardware to unleash its parallel computing capabilities. This has lead to what is sometimes called the current *AI spring* in the 2020s, and the popularization of some AI products such as LLMs. You can get a privileged perspective on that period by watching this [interview with Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eyhCTvrEtE) by Andrew Ng from deeplearning.ai.\n",

        "The output layer of a neural network behaves differently depending on the nature of the problem. \n",

        "+ **Regression:** If we are dealing with a regression problem then the output layer has a single neuron. This neuron will take as inputs the values coming from the last hidden layer, let us call them \n",
        "  \n",
        "  $A_1,\\ldots, A_k$\n",
        "  \n",
        "  and then the output layer will use its set of weights $w_1, \\ldots, w_k$ and bias term to output the affine combination:\n",

        "\n",
        "  This is the final prediction of the model. You may wonder about the activation function for this output layer, but the above is equivalent to using the identity $h(x) = x$ as activation, as we mentioned before.  \n",
        "\n",
        "+ **Binary Classification:** In this case we want to use the output as a score for the positive class of the output variable. In particular we only need the neural network to predict a aingle number. Therefore in this case again the output layer contains a single neuron. The only difference with the previous regression case is that now the activation function is not the identity but the sigmoid curve we have introduced above:\n",
        "  $\\sigma(x) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$\n",
        "\n",
        "+ **Multiclass Classification and Softmax Function:** This is a different scenario, because of the output variable is a factor with $p$ levels, then the network needs to predict scores for each of them. And so in this case the output layer contains $p$ neurons. The outputs $u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_p$ of these neurons are then typically converted into a new set of numbers $p_1, p_2,\\ldots, p_k$ by using a **softmax transformation** defined by:\n",
        "  $p_1 = \\dfrac{e^{u_1}}{e^{u_1} + e^{u_2} + \\cdots + e^{u_p}},\\quad  p_2 = \\dfrac{e^{u_2}}{e^{u_1} + e^{u_2} + \\cdots + e^{u_p}},\\quad  \\ldots \\quad , \\quad p_k = \\dfrac{e^{u_k}}{e^{u_1} + e^{u_2} + \\cdots + e^{u_p}}$\n",
        "\n",
        "  This transformation clearly implies that the numbers $p_i$ verify \n",

You can visualize and experiment with the idea using this [construction by Ben Frederiksson](http://www.benfrederickson.com/numerical-optimization/), which also contains visualizations for some other optimization methods. Or you can use our own [GeoGebra visualization](https://www.geogebra.org/m/c9n3vdnr). \n",
        "\n",
        "By playing with this visualizations you will discover that the choice of the learning parameter is critical: a too small value and the method may never converge. A too large value and the method may overshoot the minimum, possibly not converging either. There are further difficulties: the initial point of the oterations plays an important part in the success or failure of the method. Besides, if the function has several *local minimum* values the method may converge to one such local minimum and fail to find the *global minimum* value. \n",

        "The appeal of gradient descent is obvious, however, and it is based in a very simple yet powerful idea: the only critical skill it requires is the ability to **compute the gradient** of the function wherever you are. And by \"wherever you are\" we mean a point in the space of parameters (weights and biases) of the network. \n",

That loss value depends, as we keep repeating, on the current selection of weights and biases for the network. The entire selection of weights and biases is the $\\bar p$ in the description of gradient descent. Assume for a moment that we already know how to compute the gradient $\\nabla\\cal L(\\bar p)$. Then we apply the equation in the second step of gradient descent to change each weight and bias in the network. Then we run the training set through the network again, get a new gradient and so on.

For example, instead of keeping a constant learning rate, we can use a **learning rate schedule method**. A natural idea is to take longer steps at the beginning, trying to move swiftly across the possible plateaus in the loss function, and then slowing down as we may come closer to a minimum. \n",

        "This strategy can be easily accomplished by selecting a smaller than 1 **decay rate** $s$ and then multiplying the learning rate $\\lambda$ after each step by this decay rate. That means that instead of a constant learning rates now we are using an exponentially decaying sequence of (decreasing to zero) learning rates:\n",

Or we can monitor the loss and change the learing rate using that information (e. g. slowing down if we detetct that *bouncing*). The idea of momentum can be considered as well to be an optimizer. There are indeed improved version of momentum, notably **Nesterov's momentum**: it combines *momentum the past* with anticipated gradient values *from the future* to obtain a corrected update of the gradient that has been shown to perform usually better than simple momentum. In scikit-learn you can use it when you (manually) select stochastig gradient descent.\n",

The most popular of these **adaptive methods** is called **Adam** (from Adaptive Moment Estimation). You may think of the Adam and related methods as finding a decay rate taylored for each individual parameter, which takes into account the history of changes that  the parameter has undergone, ranking them by how recent they are. The MLP functions of scikit-learn use Adam and by default to implement gradient descent. \n",
