    "[The Curse of Dimensionality (see Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) refers to a certain kind of problems that appear and become severe very fast as we increase the dimension of the space in which the problem is set. An example of critical importance for Machine Learning, related to the density / sparsity of a random sample of size $n$ as we increase the number of variables in the dataset. Think about the number of empty bins in each of these figures. Note that the nuber of samples is the same (n = 10), while the density (ratio number of samples / number of bins) is, respectively, 2, 0.4, 0.08. \n",
